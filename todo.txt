[NOTES]
since monero uses openssl as a dependency (https://github.com/monero-project/monero#dependencies), I will use openssl's sha-256 for hashing emails.

hashing (pw)   : [bcrypt], scrypt, argon2, PBKDF2
hashing (email): [SHA256], MD5, SHA1
encryption     : [openssl], crypto++ (cryptopp), libsodium
decentralized file hosting: siacoin, filecoin, ipfs (free), bittorent, fleek.co (ipfs)
