[ISSUES]
Font crashes when loading (only a small few fonts are immune from this)

[DATABASE DESIGN]
neroshop - for storing application data and transactions
neroshop_user - for storing user data (accounts, settings, etc.)
* guests' cart database will be stored locally and registered users' cart data will be stored on server.
* table "users" would stored in database "neroshop_user"
edit: actually, I will keep everything in a single database since I'm not sure how the two databases will be able to communicate with one another

[LONG-TERM GOALS]
1. Privacy and Decentralization
2. User-friendly UI/UX
3. Scalibility

[HIRING]
- hire graphics programmer to fix and optimize rendering code in "renderer.cpp"
- hire network programmer to implement communication between applications and servers or implement peer-to-peer system.
- hire web developer to help develop website
- hire social media manager to manage social media accounts

[NOTES]
since monero uses openssl as a dependency (https://github.com/monero-project/monero#dependencies), I will use openssl's sha-256 for hashing emails.
passwords will be salted and hashed with bcrypt

hashing (pw)   : [bcrypt], scrypt, argon2, PBKDF2
hashing (email): [SHA256], MD5, SHA1
encryption     : [openssl], crypto++ (cryptopp), libsodium
decentralized file hosting: siacoin, filecoin, ipfs (free), bittorent

I realize that I need an online database that is scalable like MySQL or PostgreSQL 
and I cannot use SQLite since its only for offline use :(

Database Management Systems:
mySQL (GNU, paid): https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
       https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/c-api/
       https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/
postgreSQL (BSD or MIT): https://www.postgresql.org/download/    =>    https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/
                         source - https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/
                         license - https://postgresql.org/about/licence
                         cpp_bindings - http://www.pqxx.org/development/libpqxx/

Converting from SQLite to PostgreSQL:
pgloader: https://pgloader.io/about/
          docs - https://pgloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For big data and scalability, I might need to use a NoSQL database like:
MongoDB: https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/cxx/
edit: Postgres has built-in NoSQL with JSON/JSONB so there may not be a need for an alternative NoSQL database
          
SkyDB:

Considerations:
In the future, I may consider supporting other private-by-default coins such as wownero and piratechain
