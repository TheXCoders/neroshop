The name neroshop comes from "nero", meaning black combined with the word "shop".
Ever since I developed an interest for cryptocurrencies, I have become more 
privacy-conscious and more aware of the ponzi scheme that has become of the current 
financial system.
This led to my desire to want to create or at least contribute to a world where 
we can use cryptocurrency for everyday purchases rather than using it as a speculative asset
while at the same time, protecting each individual's financial privacy without having to trust any 
centralized entity, and without the risk of having your account surveilled, frozen, closed, or 
limited by how much, where and when you can spend.

I often use Amazon for my online purchases and it's a pain in the butt having to switch back 
and forth from crypto to fiat just to make purchases and on top of that dealing with having 
every crypto withdrawal subjected to taxation regardless of whether you sold at a profit or at a loss.
I started neroshop for this reason.

You may wondering why I'm using C++ for this project. Well, that's because C++ is my first 
programming language and it is the only language I know aside from Lua so I am comfortable 
using C++ for pretty much all my "big" projects.
And I have absolutely zero intention of using any other programming language. 
Web development is not really my thing either.
